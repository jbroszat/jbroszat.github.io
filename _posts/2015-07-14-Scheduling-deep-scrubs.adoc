= Scheduling deep scrubs
:hp-tags: Ceph

First, find out when Ceph performs deep scrubs. Depending on when you initially created your OSDs, you probably will notice some clustering.

=== Day of the week
[source,bash]
----
$ for date in $(ceph pg dump | grep active | awk '{print $20}'); do date +%A -d $date; done | sort | uniq -c
----

=== Time of day
[code,bash]
----
$ for date in $(ceph pg dump | grep active | awk '{print $21}'); do date +%H -d $date; done | sort | uniq -c
----

== Reschedule deep scrubs
Ceph performs deep scrubs on a weekly basis, counting from the last deep scrub. Perform a manual deep scrub on a PG or OSD an the next deep scrub will be performed exactly one week later.

For example `echo "ceph osd deep-scrub 0" | at 1am tomorrow"` will manually perform a deep scrub of every PG of osd.0 at 1am the following night. All following deep scrubs will be performed at this time of the week, every week.
